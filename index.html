            <p class="journey">
                My journey into the world of software development began as a self-taught learner, driven by curiosity
                and a passion for problem-solving. At the start, I dived into Java, where I learned how to build
                structured and object-oriented applications. While Java laid the foundation for my understanding of
                programming principles, I was eager to explore more languages and broaden my horizons.
                <br><br>
                Soon, I transitioned to learning C#, which opened the door to a deeper understanding of how modern
                applications interact with databases and frameworks. I became particularly interested in backend
                development, enjoying the challenge of creating scalable and efficient server-side applications.
                Alongside C#, I picked up front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to
                create complete web solutions from the ground up.
                <br><br>
                However, my journey didn't stop there. I discovered Go, a language known for its simplicity and
                performance in building highly concurrent applications. This became my language of choice for creating
                robust APIs and microservices. I enjoyed how Go allowed me to focus on building efficient applications
                without sacrificing simplicity.
                <br><br>
                During this period, I also attended a bootcamp called Digitalcampus in Vorarlberg. This experience not
                only honed my technical skills but also provided hands-on opportunities to work with modern technologies
                and learn industry best practices. The intensive program helped me grow as a developer and deepened my
                understanding of real-world software development.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked as a freelancer, helping companies solve code issues and optimize
                existing software. My projects varied from fixing bugs in legacy codebases to developing new features
                and improving performance. Every experience taught me more about the practical side of software
                development, including the importance of clean code, collaboration, and constant learning.
                <br><br>
                Living in Feldkirch, Austria, I continue to refine my skills, focusing on backend development and
                exploring new advancements in artificial intelligence. My passion for technology and continuous learning
                drives me to seek out challenging projects and build innovative solutions that push the boundaries of
                what's possible. any way here is where we can connect
